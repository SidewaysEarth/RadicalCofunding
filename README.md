## Radical Cobudgeting and Adaptive System Project Resourcing

This proposal starts from the point of addressing resource allocation (primarily budget allocation) within a large network of brilliant people with brilliant ideas for addressing the polycrisis as a first step towards creating a complex adaptive network organism that self-organizes to address points of leverage and urgency. 


This document spawns from more than a decade of thinking coming out of an organization currently called Sideways, which is the result of a meeting of minds among Gijs Spoor (Auraville/Green Silk Road), Grace Rachmany (Voice of Humanity), Jack Becher (Foundations Earth), James Lock (WeAreOpus), and Lakshmi Venugopal⁩ (Auraville). 


## Challenges

**Phase 1 Challenge:**  How can we surface the best projects in our “network” for resourcing (funding and personnel)? 

**Phase 2 Challenge: **How do we create a system in which projects can find the people and teams they need at each phase of the projects?

**Phase 3 Challenge: **How do we create a complex adaptive network organism that senses the areas of leverage for systems change and channels resources to address those areas?


## Phase 1:  Co-budgeting without the competition

Phase 1 Challenge:  How can we surface the best projects in our “network” for resourcing (funding and personnel)? 


### Rationale for a radical approach

But wait. Is there even such a thing as the best project? 

This radical approach addresses several challenges when it comes to democratic budgeting processes:



* Collaborative budgeting pits people and projects against one another,creating a competitive atmosphere and requiring great presentation and campaigning skills, often at the expense of great ideas.
* Collaborative funding often skips the ideation and team formation processes, assuming that the solution is somewhere out there, and we just have to pick the best one.
* Collaborative funding is unlikely to fund radical ideas or those with a longer future trajectory or wider systems impact. 

The intention of this process is to create a set of the top 5-15 projects of 12-24 months for funding.


### Identifying common areas of collaboration

During the first phase of the project, people or organizations identify themselves according to:



* Area of work (using the [Catalist Table](https://www.catalist.network/encyclopedic-table) or other framework)
* Intended scope (local, regional, national, global)
* Time horizon

Using this information, a software system will create five clusters of interest, plus one wildcard. People will be placed in a cluster, but can also choose their own cluster. 


### Clusters: creating the best projects in each area

Each cluster will create a project together. This phase is designed for group process, creation of a team that can work together, and identification of the people who can collaborate. Anyone who continues in this group, by definition, must be willing to let go of their ego and their dream project for the common good. People who are able to complete this group will need to operate well with uncertainty and lack of structure. They will need to be resilient, flexible, able to collaborate and compromise, and able to produce outcomes in an uncertain environment.

Starting conditions for each group:



* 60 days culminating in presentation day. 
* $75,000 in funding.

Each group will present:



1. Primary proposal for a 12-24 month project. The proposal will include:
    1. Challenge definition
    2. Description
    3. Measures / milestones for success
    4. Budget of up to $10,000,000
    5. WCPGW: how can it be undone if there are unintended outcomes?
    6. Governance structure for execution 
    7. Intellectual property policies 
2. “Minority opinion” proposal. This is an alternative proposal. The group will decide how / who gets to submit this alternative proposal. 
3. Retro Report
    8. Rationale for choosing these proposals.
    9. Governance for reaching decisions within the team. What would they do differently? 
    10. Budget spending report.


### Funding and data collection for Phase 2

The intention would be to fund all 10-12 proposals that come out of this process.

If successful, the process could be run every quarter, inviting others to the process as appropriate.

During this phase we will collect data that we can start to assess. Data can be collected from a Slack, Mattermost, or Discord channel and be assessed through AI, as can data recorded on voice-to-text systems for online discussions. 

We would employ a data scientist to help us understand information such as:



* Relationships between people (frequency and intensity of communication)
* Contributions and expertise of participants.
* Ability of people to stick it out when decisions didn’t go their way.
* Roles that people are fulfilling in the group.
* Attendance at meetings (who got invited, who spoke, who showed up on time, who facilitated).

Assessment of reputation can be attached to individuals or to pods of people who frequently work as a team. One hypothesis is that the formation of pods of people who work as a team will allow the group as a whole to address problems faster, because people won’t have to adjust to new working styles on every project. During the work phase, we want to do additional research on small working groups and see if we can have people name their pods and move from project to project as a pod.


## Phase 2: Team and project mapping

**Phase 2 Challenge: **How do we create a system in which projects can find the people and teams they need at each phase of the projects?

Phase 2 will include several technological implementations:



* Data collection as from Phase 1: Asynchronous chat, e-mails, scheduling, transcripts from discussions, written documentation.
* Creation of dashboards that map people’s talents, connections, etc.
* Development of two-way matching where someone can conduct a search for certain capabilities, the person being “summoned” has the ability to expose or not expose their data to the person who is asking them to join a project. (Similarly, the person making the call has their information exposed to the person they summon.)
* Development of dashboarding around the accomplishments of projects, so there is a double-layer on the reputation: Reputation within projects and the reputation of the project itself. 
* Multi-variable values for reputation. For example, some projects may value diversity and others might value reviving a specific cultural tradition and therefore eschew diverse participants. Some people might be great at offering controversial positions and stirring the pot for brainstorming, while others might be good at bridging differences. Each value is needed in different contexts.
* Contextual recommendation engines for matching people with projects.
* Onboarding capabilities for projects that weren’t spawned within the network but are aligned.
* Decentralized database storage for privacy of different groups. Provenance around who can access different types of data around the network. 
* Group certificate issuance system for subjective credentials.
* Resource sharing tracking (potentially with cryptocurrency of some type) to identify flows of resources among groups.

The results of this phase will be a robust system for matching projects and initiatives with the people who can execute.


## Phase 3: Complex adaptive network organism

**Phase 3 Challenge: **How do we create a complex adaptive network organism that senses the areas of leverage for systems change and channels resources to address those areas?

With the above two phases we are creating systems that:



* Identify salient and key issues to address
* Gather the most interested and qualified people around the topics to design problem definitions, desired outcomes and potential ways to address the issues
* Provide reputation systems for individuals and teams who can carry out the projects
* Offer funding and resourcing mechanisms for the projects

This describes a system that is a self-healing mechanism for any issues that humans can detect. During Phase 3 we would add functionality such as:



* Checks and balances / regulatory mechanisms that stem from within the groups (rather than having a management team)
* Expansion into different languages and geographies
* Sensory systems to provide objective information about key metrics 
* Reporting and knowledge management to identify best practices and offer applications across the network

This document does not specify the Phase 3 system. It occurs to us as the natural emerging system from the two first phases, but it is too early to imagine exactly how that will form itself.
